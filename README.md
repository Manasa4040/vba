# vba
in this project we made the   script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs :

The ticker symbol

Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The total stock volume of the stock. by using for loop and elseif by comparing each row value.
we can use the module for executing both vba files.
